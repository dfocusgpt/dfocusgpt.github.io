DfocusGPT’s chatbot service automates applying your organization’s knowledge to an LLM so it can answer accurately using your data.

## What is DfocusGPT for?

1. Overcome the limits of generic LLMs by combining them with your internal knowledge to deliver fast, accurate answers.
2. Speed up customer support by referencing your support manuals; no rule-based scripting required.

## Why now?
